Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services. The company is founded in 1869 and maintains offices in all major financial centers around the world. However, Goldman Sachs is far more than a financial company. In early 2017, Lloyd Blankfein (Goldman Sachs CEO) stated “We are a technology firm. We are a platform.” Every year, Goldman Sachs attracted more than a quarter of a million applications from students and graduates for jobs in summer, and the number of applications globally is said to be risen more than 40 per cent since 2012. Well, I’m really grateful to join as a Summer Analyst this year and experience all the reasons why so many people craving to join the company. 
Speaking of Investment banking, people always have the impression of the demanding industry requiring analysts and associates to work upwards of 80-100 hours per week on projects. In recent years, banks have been struggling to attract and retain talent as millennials enter the workforce and value industries with better work life balance or mission driven organizations. Goldman Sachs, leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm, is one firm that is taking steps in the right direction to employ digital technology. 
Overall, I would say that the internship in Goldman Sachs is very different to the other companies in few ways. 
[INTRODUCE Internship schedule and structure] Firstly, the internship programme itself is well built in a very structured and well organized way. Interns got to attend training in the beginning and join all kinds of different talks and social events every week. 
[EXPOSURE of meeting ppl] Secondly, the internship is well-designed in a way that way that interns get to work with a number of different people not only across the team, but also the hierarchy. I was surprised that my manager actually spent around 1 hour every day to discuss my progress with me and to keep check on whether everything is going well. In the ten weeks there, I was able to work with 20 or 25 different people for the assigned project. Not to mention the people I have met in the other events, which also brought me great influences. 
Thirdly, Goldman Sachs really trust their summer interns to bring in real business impact. Even if it's their first experience ever, interns are given a lot of responsibilities. Besides, interns often work with senior employees who have been at the bank over 10 years. I have to say it felt good to see people believe in you and even try to learn from you. 
Fourthly, superiors take full responsibility for their interns' mistakes: although analysts and associates give interns responsibilities, they will review their work and give them feedback so they can improve rather than shout at them. This creates a feeling of comparative security and makes it easier to learn.

I was doing internship as a summer analyst in Goldman Sachs Technology division this year. 

Besides computer science, I am doing double major in finance as well. As a result, I am really interested in those financial knowledges in banking company. I am also interested in applying those technology to the business area. It becomes one of the main reasons that I would choose an investment bank for my internship. I believe here could be the most suitable place for my interests and skillset. 
	Due to the company policy, I am not allowed to disclose any project related detail in this report, so I can only briefly introduce my work. I was responsible for a migration of legacy system during my internship.  The technology used in investment bank is always not the most cutting-edge one. For example, machine learning is not trendy in our company because it is hard to explain to logic to the customers or compliance. Besides, the bank will always take the system with rather low risk to ensure that the whole functionality could be stable. However, I learned a lot complicated business logic during my internship. It is not like doing a project at school that we are exposed to something new but the functional requirement is rather simple. During my internship, the most difficult things are not implementation but understanding the user’s requirement and communicating with others. Since it is my first internship working in a big and formal company, what I have learnt most should be having a taste of a complete software development lifecycle.  We are using the agile project development. For each project, we will have a POC. Then we still have the flexibility to change design if we found something is not feasible. During my internship, I also faced the similar issue. The system I used cannot support some functions I need for my project so that I could not meet the user’s requirement. As a result, I had to change the design in my last weeks. Since it is normal and reasonable to happen during a project development, even though it may affect the progress of my project, the turning point didn’t disappoint me. Actually I really appreciated I could have such a unique experience during my internship. Besides the development cycle, I felt that I learned a lot about coding style. I used to code in my own way. Sometimes I didn’t take the coding style serious as if I can understand it myself. However, working in a large company, it is common to have many people corporate on the same project. The clear and standard coding style could make other better understand your logic. I really found that important since I did the internship this year. 
	Besides the team project, we have different activities during the internship. For example, we have a three days hackathon to work on a small project. We also had a community team work which is cleaning up a beach. There are different networking event throughout the whole internship period so that I have got a chance to know people from different background and different divisions. 
	Before I did the internship, I thought that working in an investment banking would be crazily overtime. However, it is not the case for technology division. I rarely OT in the two months so that I can still have a good work life balance for my summer vacation. Overall speaking, I really enjoyed my internship and appreciated that I have got a chance to experience in a well-organized company.
